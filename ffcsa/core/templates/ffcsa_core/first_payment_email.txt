Hi

We have received your first month's payment and you are now able to make your first order.

Just a friendly reminder that your order must be put together by Wednesday at midnight each week. This is very
    important to ensure that we can get all your veggies on time. If your order is not submitted on time, you will not
    receive an order that week.

Please bring your own containers to the pick up sight which could include shopping bags, coolers or totes, whatever
    is easiest for you.

Jar Return Policy: you can get $3 back for returning a clean, dry, 1/2 gallon glass jar with PLASTIC
    lid attached (we will not give money back for jars with sharpie on the outside, with a smell on the inside, jars
    with metal lids, or with no lids. We always pack them with the plastic, more expensive lids because they last
    longer). You can get this refund at your regular dropsite: farmer's markets, Corner Market and the Deck Family Farm.
    The reps at all these places will know to check the cleanliness and lid-state of all jars before accepting them. The
    price of this deposit is worked into the "value" of each 1/2 gal of milk ordered on the member store. The quart jars
    can also be returned to the dropsite, but no refund is given for these.

Thanks so much again for being part of our Full Farm CSA. We are looking forward to working with you!
Ella and The Team.
